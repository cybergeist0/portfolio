C++ is a powerful, high-performance language used in game dev, systems programming, and competitive coding. Here's a quick guide to begin:

## 1. Install Tools
- **Compiler**: GCC (Linux), Clang (macOS), MSVC (Windows)
- **IDE/Text Editor**: VS Code, CLion, Code::Blocks, or online IDEs like [Replit](https://replit.com)

## 2. Your First Program
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Compile & run:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```

## 3. Learn the Basics
- Variables, data types, loops, conditionals
- Functions and arrays
- Input/output with `cin` and `cout`

## 4. Practice and Build
- Try problems on LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank
- Build simple projects (calculator, games, etc.)
- Explore the Standard Template Library (STL)

## 5. Go Deeper
- Pointers, memory management
- OOP (classes, inheritance)
- File I/O, advanced algorithms
